							<h2>Marginal Cost</h2>
						
						
                            <p>The increase or decrease in the total cost to provide or make one additional unit of an item. It is computed in situations where the breakeven point has been reached: 
                                the fixed costs have already been absorbed and only the direct (variable) costs have to be accounted for. 
                                </br>
                                Marginal costs are variable costs consisting of labour and material costs, 
                                plus an estimated portion of fixed costs (such as administration overheads and selling expenses). 
                                However, in industries that require heavy capital investment (Hotel plants, airlines, other hospitality services) 
                                and have high average costs, the marginal cost is comparatively very low. 
                                </br>
                                The concept of marginal cost is critically important in resource allocation because, for optimum results,
                                 management must concentrate its resources where the excess of marginal revenue over the marginal cost is maximum. 
                                 It is also called choice cost, differential cost, or incremental cost.
                             </p>

                                <u>Marginal Cost Equation</u></br>

                                Marginal Cost 		= 	Change in Total Cost (ΔTC)/ 
                                                        Change in Output (ΔQ ) 
                                
                             </p>
                            <p><u>Application of Marginal cost for pricing decisions</u> </br>
                                <b>Application 1:<u> optimum selling price for Price Deals</u> </b><?br>
                                To determine the optimum selling price of any product or service is a big challenge for a manager of 
                                any company because a company wants to profit from each unit of any product or service. 
                                In the marginal costing technique, fixed cost will not be changed at any level of production or service. 
                                Only variable cost is changed in order to obtain the optimum selling price where the company can achieve expected profit.
                                 </br>
                                <b>Application 2: <u>Reduce prices to achieve competitive price levels </u></b></br>
                                    This can be applied to filling seats on planes/rooms in hotels in the tourism and hospitality industry.
                                    The tourism and hospitality industry is facing a huge amount of competition with a large number of operators.
                                    Therefore cost can be considered as one main factor. To attract customers,
                                    a company should provide products and services at minimum price. But on the other hand, 
                                    a company wants to maintain their current profit levels. In this situation, 
                                    management will face the prospect that it may not be possible to maintain a profit after reducing prices. 
                                    However if management learns the marginal costing techniques and uses them effectively, 
                                    they can check the effect of reducing the current price on net profit. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Application 3: <u>Marginal costing for last minute offers at discounted prices </u></b>
                                At the last minute, a company has to give special discount to attract more customers. 
                                These customers may be tourists or passengers. At this time, 
                                management has to make the decision about what level of discount they can give to these customers. 
                            </p>
                            <p><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Marginal Costing</h3>
                                <b><u>Advantages</u></b></br>
                                <b>Cost control:</b> Marginal costing makes it easier to determine and control costs of production. 
                                By avoiding the arbitrary allocation of fixed overhead costs, management can concentrate on achieving and 
                                maintaining a uniform and consistent marginal cost. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Simplicity</b>: Marginal costing is simple to understand and operate and it can be combined with other 
                                forms of costing (e.g. budgetary costing and standard costing) without much difficulty. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Elimination of cost variance per unit</b>: Since fixed overheads are not charged to the cost of production 
                                in marginal costing, units have a standard cost. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Short-term profit planning</b>: Marginal costing can help in short-term profit planning and is easily
                                 demonstrated with break-even charts and profit graphs. Comparative profitability can be easily assessed 
                                 and brought to the notice of the management for decision-making. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Accurate overhead recovery rate</b>: This method of costing eliminates large balances left in overhead control 
                                ccounts, which makes it easier to ascertain an accurate overhead recovery rate.
                                </br> 
                                <b>Maximum return to the business</b>: With marginal costing, the effects of alternative sales or production 
                                policies are more readily appreciated and assessed, ensuring that the decisions taken will yield the maximum 
                                return to the business. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Disadvantages </br>
                                <b>Classifying costs</b>: It is very difficult to separate all costs into fixed and variable costs
                                 clearly, since all costs are variable in the long run. Hence such classification sometimes may give
                                  misleading results. Furthermore, in a firm with many different kinds of products, marginal costing 
                                  can prove less useful. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Accurately representing profits</b>: Since the closing stock consists only of variable costs and
                                 ignores fixed costs (which could be considerable), this gives a distorted picture of profits to 
                                 shareholders. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Semi-variable costs</b>: Semi-variable costs are either excluded or incorrectly analysed, 
                                leading to distortions. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Recovery of overheads</b>: With marginal costing, there is often the problem of under or 
                                over-recovery of overheads, since variable costs are apportioned on an estimated basis and not 
                                on actual value.
                                </br> 
                                <b>External reporting</b>: Marginal costing cannot be used in external reports, 
                                which must have a complete view of all indirect and overhead costs. 
                                </br>
                                <b>Increasing costs</b>: Since it is based on historical data, marginal costing can give an 
                                inaccurate picture in the presence of increasing costs or increasing production.
