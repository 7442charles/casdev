						</p>	
						<p>
							A2) <b>Private Law</b><br />

								 in case of imprisonment, or the amount of fine payable.<br />

								<b>In Kenya the sources of law are identified as;</b><br />
								The Constitution<br />
								The Judicature Act<br />
								Kadhis Court Act<br />
								Hindu Marriages and Divorce Act<br />
								Hindu Succession Act, etc.<br />
								These sources of law are categorized into two (2) main areas; -
								Written Sources<br />
								Unwritten sources<br />
								The sources of law appear in their order of superiority under a hierarchy known as <b>Legal Pyramid.
								Constitution</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Written Laws:</b> - These are rules of law that have been reduced into written form. They are embodied in a formal in a formal document, e.g.
								Constitution of Kenya, Acts of parliament and General statutes. These laws prevail upon unwritten laws.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Unwritten Laws:</b> - These are rules of law that have not been reduced to written form. They are not embodied in any single document, e.g. African Customary Law.
								Their existence must therefore be proved.
							</p>

							<p>	
								<b>1. The Constitution</b>
								This is a public document describing the relationship between the state and her citizen as well as the different organs of the state. It forms the basis or the source from which other laws derive their validity.
								It is the document in which most fundamental rules of the law are written.
								The constitution was enacted by the British parliament on 12th December 1963, for the purpose of granting Kenya independence. Our constitution has been fundamentally amended, with the first amendment being done on 12th December 1964, when Kenya became a republic headed by a president.
								The constitution is most supreme law.
								It has 80 major chapters, with 264 articles and many sections and sub-sections. Section 256 (1-5) of the constitution empowers parliament to make amendments to the constitution.<br />
								<p><b>Supremacy of the constitution</b><br />
								Section 2 (1-6) of the current constitution demonstrates the supremacy of the constitution in the following manner;<br /></p>
								<p><b>a) Supremacy clause (Sec 2 (1)):</b>
								This section states that this constitution is the supreme law of the republic and bid all persons and all states organ at both levels of government.<br />
								<b>b) Authoritative clause (Sec 2 (2)):</b>
								This clause states that no person may claim or exercise state authority except as authorized under this constitution.<br />
								<b>c) Legal/ Validity clause (Sec 2 (3)):</b>
								The legality/ validity of the constitution is not subject to challenge by any court or state organ.<br />
								<b>d) Consistency clause (Sec 2 (4)):</b>
								This section provides that any law including customary law is inconsistent with this constitution is void to the extent of such inconsistent, i.e. the law has no legal basis.<br />
								<b>e) Organs of government:</b>
								The constitution creates the principle offices and organs of government, e.g. chapter 10 – Judiciary, Chapter 9 – Executive, and Chapter 8 – Legislature.<br />
								<b>f) Fundamental rights and freedoms:</b>
								Chapter 4 – the constitution has recognized and provided for the fundamental right of individual through the bill of rights.<br />
								<b>g) Powers</b>
								It has created the highest office on the land, i.e. Office of the President and vested upon the president the powers of the head of state. It has also created the highest court in the land, Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>2. Acts of parliament</b><br />
								These are laws or statutes passed by the legislature (parliament).
								<b>They are divided into two categories:</b>
								a) Direct/ Primary Legislation<br />
								b) Indirect/ Secondary/ Subordinate/ Delegated Legislation<br />
								<b>Direct Legislation</b>
								This is the law making process which involves Parliamentarians (MPs)/ or elected leaders coming up with laws. It is also the process of making laws by parliament.<br />
								The constitution empowers parliament to make laws on behalf of the state. A member will come up with a proposed law, which is drafted as a Bill. The bill will undergo various stages before it transforms into a law (statute).
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Classification of bills</b><br />
								Bills are classified on two (2) dimensions; - Sponsor and/ or Content (Target groups)
							</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Sponsor</td>
					<td>Content or Target groups</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1.<b> Government Bill:</b> - These are sponsored by government through the Attorney General. The AG drafts the bill on behalf of the government and forwards it to parliament via Leader of the Majority.
						 The AG also gives advice on such bills.</td>
						 <td>1.<b> Public Bill:</b> - This is a bill of proposal concerning the entire public at large, e.g. 
							 It seeks to alter the laws about Kenya, e.g. 
							 The Marriage Bill 2011.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2. <b>Private members bill:</b> - This where a member of parliament and acting on behalf of the government makes a proposal either concerning the entire public, or private entity, or constituents. The AG may give advice,
						 but is not required to draft it and therefore the MP will have to seek the services of a legal expert.</td>
						 <td>2.<b> Private Bills:</b> - These are proposals which affect specific groups in the society, e.g. Accountants, Hr Professionals.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><b>LAW MAKING PROCESS IN KENYA (LIFE CYCLE OF A BILL)</b>
				a) <b>1st Stage: - Publication of the bill in Kenya Gazette</b><br />
				A bill is required to be published in the Kenya Gazette for at least 14 days. This creates awareness to the public who may advance opinion on the subject.
				b) <b>2nd Stage: First Reading of the bill</b><br />
				After 14 days the bill is introduced in parliament. The clerk of the National Assembly or MP concerned reads the title; this makes MPs aware the bill is on the floor of the
				house. The MPs set out the date for the next meeting after copies have been distributed to them.<br />
				c) <b>3rd Stage: 2nd Reading of the bill</b><br />
				The MPs read out the bill and a debate ensues. They are required at the end of the session to vote for or against the bill. Once voting has taken place, the bill can be accepted and move to the next stage, or rejected and required to wait for at least 6 months before it begins the cycle again.
				d) <b>4th Stage: Committee stage</b><br />
				This may comprise the committee of the whole house or selected persons. The chairman will appointed to chair the meeting. Deliberations will be undertaken any recommendations incorporated.<br />
				e) <b>5th Stage: Report stage</b><br />
				The chairman shall report to the house on any recommendations made. Copies of the amended bill will be circulated and a debate may ensue from those recommendations. A vote may also occur.
				f) <b>6th Stage: 3rd Reading of the bill</b><br />
				This is another crucial stage of the bill, since voting must take place where the bill must achieve the general requirement of two (2) thirds’ majority vote (65%). If the bill is rejected, it will wait for a period of 6 months before it can go through the cycle again.
				g) <b>7th Stage: Presidential Assent</b><br />
				All laws of Kenya must be assent to by the President. When parliament has passed a proposed law is presented to the President for his assent within a period of 21 days<br />
				If he does not assent, the MPs will move a motion that the speaker requests him to table a memorandum with the reasons and recommendations that may arise. This must be done between 14 days.
				The MPs may then incorporate the President’s recommendations and return the bill for his assent.
				Once assented, the bill becomes an Act of parliament
				h) <b>8th Stage: Gazettement of the Act</b><br />
				All laws in Kenya must be gazetted in the Kenya Gazette before they are applied as laws in Kenya. Once Gazetted every citizen is expected to abide to the law and therefore, presumption that ignorance of law is no defence in court.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Indirect/ Secondary/ Subordinate/ Delegated Legislation</b><br />
				These are laws made by persons/ institutions/ bodies other than parliament. This is because parliament may not always be in session and even when it is the procedure of law making; it is slow to cope with matters of public interest.
				As a result of this, the parliament has power to delegate or pass on law making authority to subordinate bodies. These bodies derive their authority to such laws from the parent/ enabling legislation.
				Forms of delegated legislation<br />
				a) <b>By laws:</b> - They are made by local authorities under local government Acts, or co-operative societies.<br />
				b) <b>Rules and orders:</b> - They are usually made by government ministers in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by the enabling Acts, e.g Tourism Rules and Regulations, Transport Rules and Regulations, Basic Education rules and regulations, etc.
