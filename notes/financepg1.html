						</header>
						<p><b></b>A hotel manager is in</b> - charge of all the operations of a hotel. 
							He/ she lays down the necessary plans to drive and grow the hotel towards success. 
							The success of any business is shown by a change (increase) in its profitability and/ or a change (increase) in its resources/ assets. </p>
						<p>Accounting provides the evidence of this by recording all the transactions that have a financial implication on the business. It identifies all these transactions, 
							measures them and reports on their final implication on profitability (financial performance) 
							and the assets (financial position) of the business. </p>
							<p>The end goal/ ultimate objective of accounting is therefore to report on the success of the business through final financial reports of profitability and assets; referred to as statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position (assets) respectively.
								The information produced by these two statements serves the hotel manager as well as other users of accounting information to make better and informed decisions regarding their interest in the business.
								Accounting therefore refers to the process/ system that is put in place to record, summarize and report financial information of a business to the interested parties/ users of accounting information.</p>
