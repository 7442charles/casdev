						<u>TYPES OF COST</u></br>
                            <b> 1. DIRECT COST</b></br>
                            A direct cost is one that is traceable to and is the responsibility of a 
                            particular operating department or division.
                             Most direct costs are variable by nature and will increase or 
                             decrease in direct relation to increases and decreases in sales revenue. 
                             For this reason, direct costs tend to be controllable by, and the responsibility of, 
                             the department or division manager to which they are charged.
                             Examples of these types of costs are cost of sales–food and –beverages,
                             wages and salaries, operating supplies and services, and linen and laundry.
                            </p>

                             <p><b>2. INDIRECT COST</b></br>
                                An indirect cost is one that cannot be identified with 
                                and is not traceable to a particular operating department or division, and thus, 
                                cannot be charged to any specific department or division. 
                                General building maintenance could only be charged to various departments or divisions
                                 (such as rooms, food, or beverage) with difficulty. Even if this difficulty could be overcome, 
                                 it must still be recognized
                                that indirect costs cannot normally be considered the responsibility of operating departments’ 
                                or divisions’ managers. Indirect costs are frequently referred to as undistributed costs 
                                (also referred to as overhead costs).
                            </p>
                            <p><b>3. CONTROLLABLE AND NONCONTROLLABLE COSTS</b></br>
                                If a cost is controllable, the manager can influence the amount spent.
                                 For example, the kitchen manager can influence the amount spent on food. 
                                 However, it is unlikely the kitchen manager can influence the amount spent on rent, 
                                 especially in the short term.
                                  The mistake is often made of calling direct costs controllable costs and indirect costs noncontrollable costs. 
                                  It is true that direct
                                costs are generally more easily controlled than indirect costs,
                                 but in the long run all costs are controllable by someone at some time.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>4. JOINT COST</b></br>
                                A joint cost is one that is shared by, and thus is the responsibility of, 
                                two or more departments or areas.
                                 A dining room server who serves both food and beverage is an example. 
                                 The server’s wages are a joint cost and should be charged (in proportion to sales revenue,
                                  or by some other appropriate method) partly to the food department and the remainder to the beverage department. 
                                  Most indirect
                                costs are also joint costs. 
                                The problem is to find a rational basis for separating the cost and charging part of it to each department.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>5.DISCRETIONARY COST</b></br>
                                This is a cost that may or may not be incurred based on the decision of a particular person,
                                 usually the general manager. Nonemergency maintenance is an example of a discretionary cost. 
                                 The building exterior could be painted this year, or the painting could be postponed until next year. 
                                 Either way, sales revenue should not be affected. The general manager has the choice; thus, it is a
                                discretionary cost. Note that a discretionary cost is only discretionary in the short run. For example,
                                 the building will have to be painted at some time in order
                                to maintain its appearance.
                            </p>
                            <p><h3><u>RELEVANT AND NONRELEVANT COSTS</u></h3>
                                A relevant cost is a cost that affects a decision. 
                                To be relevant, a cost must be in the future and different between alternatives.
                                 For example, a restaurant is considering replacing its mechanical cash register with an electronic one. 
                                 The relevant costs would be the cost of the new register (less any trade-in of the old  one), 
                                 the cost of training employees on the new equipment, and any change in maintenance and material
                                  supply costs on the new machine.
                                  As long as no change is necessary in the number of servers required, 
                                  the restaurant’s labor cost would not be a relevant cost. 
                                  It would make no difference to the decision.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>i.SUNK COST</b></br>
                                A sunk cost is a cost already incurred and about which nothing can be done.
                                 It cannot affect any future decisions. For example, 
                                 if the same restaurant had spent $250 for an employee to study the relative merits of
                                  using mechanical or electronic registers, the $250 is a sunk cost. 
                                  It cannot make any difference to the decision, and should not be included in any assessment of
                                   the costs of the registers.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>ii. OPPORTUNITY COST</b></br>
                                An opportunity cost is the cost of not doing something. 
                                An organization can invest its surplus cash in marketable securities at 10%, 
                                or leave the money in the bank at 6%. If it buys marketable securities, 
                                its opportunity cost is 6%. Another way to look at it is to say that it is making 10% 
                                on the investment, less the opportunity cost of 6%; therefore, the net gain is a 4% interest rate.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>iii. FIXED COST</b></br>
                                Fixed costs are not expected to change in the short run of an operating period of a 
                                year or less, and will not vary with increases or decreases in sales revenue. 
                                Examples include management salaries, fire insurance expense, rent paid on a square-foot 
                                basis, or the committed cost of an advertising campaign. Over the long run fixed costs can,
                                 of course, change, but in the short run they are not expected to change. 
                                 If a fixed cost should change over the short run, the change would normally result only from
                                  a decision of specific top management.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>iv. VARIABLE COST</b></br>
                                A variable cost is one that changes in direct proportion to a change in sales revenue. 
                                Very few costs are strictly linear, but two that are 
                                (with only a slight possibility that they will not always fit this strict definition) 
                                are the cost of sales of food and beverages. 
                                The more food and beverages sold, the more costs will be incurred. 
                                If sales revenues are zero, no food or beverage costs are incurred.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>v. SEMIFIXED OR SEMIVARIABLE COSTS</b></br>
                                Most costs do not fit neatly into the fixed or the variable category—they have 
                                an element of fixed cost and an element of variable cost. As well, 
                                they are not always variable directly to sales revenues on a straight-line basis. 
                                Such costs  would include payroll, maintenance, and utilities. 
                                To make some useful decisions, it is advantageous to break down these semifixed or
                                 semivariable costs
                                into their two elements: fixed or variable.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>vi. STANDARD COST</b></br>
                                A standard cost is what the cost should be for a given volume or level of sales. 
                                We saw some uses of such standards in Chapter 5. 
                                Other uses would be in pricing decisions (Chapter 6), in budgeting (Chapter 9), 
                                and in expansion planning (Chapter 13).
                                 Standard costs need to be developed by each establishment because there are many factors
                                  that influence standard costs and that differ from
                                one establishment to another. Let us look at some of the ways in which an analysis of the 
                                type(s) of cost(s) with which we are dealing would help us make a better decision.
                            </p>
